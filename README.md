# ⏳ Multi-Event Countdown Timer Web Application

## 📌 Project Title
**Multi-Event Countdown Timer**

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## 🎯 Objective
This web app allows users to create and manage multiple countdown events. Each event displays the time remaining (days, hours, minutes, and seconds) until the target date and time. Events can repeat (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and include optional browser notifications and an alarm when they expire.

## ✨ Features
- Add multiple countdown events with title, date, time, and repeat options.
- Layout customization: List, Grid, and Carousel views.
- Event size adjustment: Small, Medium, Large.
- Alarm sound and "Event Today" message.
- Browser notification reminders 1 day before an event.
- Persistent storage using `localStorage`.
- Edit or delete existing events.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Add Event**: Enter event title, date, time, and choose recurrence.
2. **Countdown Display**: Live countdown updates every second.
3. **Reminder Notification**: A browser notification appears one day before the event (at 9AM).
4. **On Completion**: Alarm sounds, and if it's a repeating event, it resets to the next cycle.
